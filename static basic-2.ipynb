    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers and remains a more robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "Mode: Outliers can influence the mode if they are frequent enough, though less commonly.\n",
    "Range: Outliers can greatly expand the range by increasing the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers increase variance and standard deviation because they increase the average squared deviation from the mean.\"\"\"\n",
